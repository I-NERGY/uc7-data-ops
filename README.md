# EDA, useful data operations, and harmonization on UC7 datasets
- This repo can be used to produce the time series format (tsformat) dataset eda.ipynb).
- It can be used to conduct exploratory data analysis with plotly on UC7 datasets (eda.ipynb).
- It also includes the renewed version of the harmonization process, based on the new structure of ASM datasets, also addressing the errors of the previous work. (harmonization.ipynb)

All operations require the full_data_correct_cols format which can be produced through UC7_to_multiple_ts_format.ipynb.
